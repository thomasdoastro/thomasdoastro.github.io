# About me

Hello everyone! My name is Thomas Do and I am a first year astronomy graduate student at Michigan State University. My current focus is black holes, but I have experience with working in extragalactic astronomy (studying the CGM) and solar physics (creating models of diffusive shock acceleration). Please contact me if you have any questions for me!
